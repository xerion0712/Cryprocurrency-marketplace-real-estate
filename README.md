# Decentralized Real Estate Registry on Ethereum

This solution implements a blockchain-based real estate platform in which each property is digitally represented as an ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT). Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) are utilized to ensure confidential ownership verification. The platform is developed with Solidity, ZoKrates, and features integration with external NFT trading platforms such as OpenSea.

## Solution Highlights

- **Property Tokenization**: Real estate assets are individually tokenized as ERC721-compliant NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Confidential Ownership Verification**: Title ownership can be validated using ZK-SNARKs, constructed and verified through ZoKrates, preventing exposure of non-essential personal or transaction information.
- **Marketplace Interoperability**: NFTs are compatible with external marketplaces and can be listed, transferred, or traded. Test deployment integrates with OpenSea (testnet support available).

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity, Truffle, OpenZeppelin ERC721 modules.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: ZoKrates framework for constructing and validating ZK-SNARKs.
- **Development Tools**: Docker for containerized environments, Infura for decentralized node access, Remix IDE for interactive contract management.

## Quickstart Procedure

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
   `npm install`
2. Deploy the contracts to the desired network, for example:  
   `truffle migrate --network rinkeby`
3. Mint property NFTs via Remix IDE or directly through OpenSea integration.

**Example Contract Address**:  
`0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
